-Aversatile Will As Agreed Only Scan & Gather OSINT On Only 1 Domain/IPv4 Address

-Aversatile Will Not Focus On OWASP Top 10 General Vulnerabilities but may encounter such vulnerabilities in the scans performed.

-Aversatile’s Report will consist of 1 summary report and two/2 (.txt) files containing the raw information that the scans which makes the bulk of the report with the gathered OSINT(Open Source Intelligence) has produced which in turn can be used to specify the possibly detected vulnerability/vulnerabilities that the summary report mentions.

-Aversatile, on his part will scan the requested domain or IPv4 address for discovered vulnerabilities that are found in the databases within the Vulscan “https://github.com/scipag/vulscan” Script which is derived from the following online databases which can be found at, IBM X-Force  |  Securitytracker  |  Securityfocus  |  VulDB  |  OSVDB  |  Openvas (Nessus)  |  ExploitDB  |  MITRE CVE, and also using the Vuln script category of Nmap which can be broken down into further scripts that can be found : “https://nmap.org/nsedoc/categories/vuln.html” & finally gather OSINT(Open Source Intelligence) from various nmap scan options and services on the web which can be found using the OSINT Framework "https://osintframework.com".

-Aversatile wishes to inform the client that the scans performed & information gathered are time specific and as which most likely can not be useful after an extended period of time after the date on which the scan was completed which is mentioned in the title page due to the appearance of new vulnerabilities within software in general.
