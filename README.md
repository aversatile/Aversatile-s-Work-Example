This Example Is Made After The Work I Will (By God's Will) Submit Back To My Clients After A Requested Job On Fiverr.

Disclaimer : 
-Aversatile Will As Agreed Only Scan & Gather OSINT On Only 1 Domain/IPv4 Address

-Aversatile Will Not Focus On OWASP Vulnerabilities but may encounter such vulnerabilities in the scans performed.

-Aversatile Wishes To Duly Notice The Client That The Vulnerability Section Of The Scan Performed Will Only Be “Comparing Service/Service Versions To The Vulnerability Databases(Which Will Be Defined Below), and Thus Can End Up With False – Positives Due To  “Not Checking To See Whether It Is True(Full On Pen-Testing)” and “Is Not Operating System Specific” 

-Aversatile’s Report will consist of 1 summary report(.pdf) and two/2 (.txt) files containing the raw information that the scans which makes the bulk of the report with the gathered OSINT(Open Source Intelligence) has produced which in turn can be used to specify the possibly detected vulnerability/vulnerabilities that the summary report mentions.

-Aversatile, on his part will scan the requested domain or IPv4 address for discovered vulnerabilities that are found in the databases derived from the following online databases which can be found at, IBM X-Force | Securitytracker | Securityfocus | VulDB | OSVDB | Openvas (Nessus) | ExploitDB | MITRE CVE, but are not tested and thus allowing the possible existence of false-positives which may include vulnerabilities for older(Maybe Older Than The Client’s Requested Server) versions of the specified software & finally gather OSINT(Open Source Intelligence) with services on the web which can be found using the OSINT Framework "https://osintframework.com" & others.

-Aversatile wishes to inform the client that the scans performed & information gathered are time specific and as which most likely can not be useful after an extended period of time after the date on which the scan was completed which is mentioned in the title page due to the appearance of new vulnerabilities within software in general.
